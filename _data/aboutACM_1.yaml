  Our BU chapter has some specific goals in mind:

  + Incorporate new/prospective CS students into the BU CS community
  + Provide workshops and resources to CS students that will introduce them to sub-fields of computer science
  + Demonstrate how other fields/majors can be incorporated with computer science to create new and exciting projects (cross-denominational work)
