  The Association for Computing Machinery is a nationally recognized organization that is dedicated to keeping computer scientists up-to-date and providing students with a multitude of learning and professional resources.

  Our BU chapter has some specific goals in mind:

  + Incorporate new/prospective CS students into the BU CS community
  + Provide workshops and resources to CS students that will introduce them to sub-fields of computer science
  + Demonstrate how other fields/majors can be incorporated with computer science to create new and exciting projects (cross-denominational work)
