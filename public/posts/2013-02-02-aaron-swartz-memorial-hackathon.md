## Intro

Aaron was a hacktivist and friend of many in our community. He helped create RSS 1.0; contributed to Creative Commons; was an early builder of Reddit, where he's often acknowledged as a co-founder; created the web.py framework; and more recently, became a data liberator, first with PACER and then with scholarly articles from JSTOR, both of which got him into trouble with the law.

Aaron's Demand Progress project helped stop SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act in the US, which threatened to have far reaching unintended consequences.

Aaron Swartz committed suicide on Jan. 11, 2013, but his work on making the world a better place should not die with him. Join us for two days of understanding his work and contributing to keep his memory and projects alive.

## Location

Room B26 in the Math and Computer Science building on 111 Cummington St, Boston MA 02215. (We are located in the basement)

## Schedule

Start: 12pm Feb 2

1pm: Hackathon Opening Meeting. Brainstorming, discussion of projects, organizing into groups.

8pm: Touch base meeting-- talk about what everyone's been working on.

Sometime during the day on Sunday we'll have a closing meeting and sendoff where we discuss what's been worked on over the weekend. We'll decide when this is happening once everyone has a chance to get started on projects Saturday. We can't stay in the rooms later than 8pm on Sunday, so the sendoff meeting will be before then, and we'll update the schedule here as soon as a time has been decided.

Note this schedule will be updated as the week progresses.

## Our space

We're associated with Boston University, so I've gotta throw in a disclaimer asking everyone to be considerate of our affiliation and not do anything illegal. Alcohol isn't condoned on school property.

## Projects

Check out this page for ongoing projects/ideas happening in BUILDS!(also listed are projects that were worked on at the hackathon at Noisebridge (in SF) [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak6vWXbGTU6MdDJVaGxaNHRzVUNJaVQ2SDhXRmh5VXc#gid=3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak6vWXbGTU6MdDJVaGxaNHRzVUNJaVQ2SDhXRmh5VXc#gid=3)

Bring whatever you'd like to work on; we have a lot of power outlets. Our hackerspace has more of a computer science/electrical engineering slant, so if you're planning on doing physical work, we don't have a lot of space/equipment to offer in the way of that but we'll try and accomodate. Let us know beforehand if you have something particular in mind!
