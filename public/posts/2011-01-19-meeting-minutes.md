## BUILDS Meeting
01/19/2011

### John-Nicholas Furst/Kyle Brogle
* Greetings and Happy New Year!
	* If you didn't see it already, check out the awesome new monitor on the door!

### Valerie Young
* Musical Stairs
	* First off, congrats/mucho thanks due to all those who arrived early in the year and did such an incredible job on the model.
	* Work will continue immediately after today's meeting.

### Kyle Brogle
* There's a course this semester, CS212, a sort of "introduction" to programming with an arduino
	* The entire course will be centered around building ROBOTS.
	* If you're interested, talk to Kyle/ sign up for yourself.

### Ian Felder
* Vegetable Oil Car
	* Bad news, the parts from the previously built car are no longer available.
	* Also, the build would have to take place in the Warren Parking garage (it's cold).
	* The build will most likely start in the fall.

### Jeff Crowell
* CNC drawbot
	* It's like a 3D etch-a-sketch that you can use to draw awesome objects.

### Kyle Brogle/John-Nicholas Furst
* New policies
	* Starting this semester, we want EVERYBODY who uses the room regularly to GET INVOLVED in projects
	* The website will be updated soon to accomodate Project leaders keeping track of members who are, in fact, involved in their projects.
	* The point is that BUILDS was created as a project space. Over the course of the past year, however, it has become more study- oriented.
	* This is not a BAD thing, but it is not the purpose of this space.
	* People are still welcome to study at BUILDS, we just ask those that use the room regularly to be actively involved in the spirit of BUILDS.
	* NOTE: THERE WILL BE/ARE TONS OF PROJECTS FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU CAN'T FIND YOU NICHE, CREATE ONE.

### Danny Cooper/Monica Gribouski/Liam Wang
* OpenGL
	* All those interested should contact the above.
	* Meetings are Tuesday nights.

### Valerie Young
* CLEAN UP THE ROOM.

Meeting ended 7:05 PM
