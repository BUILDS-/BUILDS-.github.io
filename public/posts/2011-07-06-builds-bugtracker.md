## Objective

I want a project issue tracker

### Background

We do projects! We need someway to track progress and more importantly to track issues. We are distributed and many times multiple people work on a project. A bugtracker can be perfectly utilized for this purpose.

### Software

Up for consideration:

[Mantis](http://www.mantisbt.org/)

[BugZilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/)

Another option is [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/).

Trac is another great tool. However it is a bit bloated and a hefty install. It has its own wiki which just adds unneeded overhead when we already have one.

### Steps

- Install Mantis on a BUILDS server
- Add links to Mantis on Builds homepage
- Post update to BUILDS homepage about new feature
- Send e-mail about new feature
