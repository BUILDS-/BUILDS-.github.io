## 02/20/2013

- Architects are touring the room	this week, so that BU can redo the MCS building. Azer thinks we're a good representative of how the building should look. From	11-12 Thursday,	next Tuesday, and the Thursday and Friday after this, they'll be here.

- Tomorrow at 5:30, RISCS is holding a recruiting and information session at the Hariri. There's also free food.

- Professor Goldberg is hosting a colloquium on security and privacy (Boston Freedom of Communications Day) on March 8th, and you guys should all go. If you want to go, you should register for planning purposes.

- Chris, John and Dan are working on a laser-light display, which should be happening in the next few weeks.

- BUILDS T-shirt orders are going out soon.

- We should start thinking about officer elections for the end of the year.

- CTF updates: We've talked to the PTHC (Northeastern Security Club, don't Google though) people, and they're going to help us make challenges and stuff. We've roughly pencilled in a date for early June, but that's very preliminary. If	you want to help create or test challenges, come talk to Allan, Jeff Crowell or me.
