### Workshop 2 (TBD): BUILDSduino Explosion

### Workshop 1 (2/5/12 @ 1:00pm): Through Hole Soldering and Protoboard Prototyping

#### Plans

1. Soldering Safety.

2. Soldering on scrap boards.

3. Review of Trinket, how would one build it given certain design specs.

4. Build trinket.

5. Go on your way with awesome soldering powers.

#### Automatic Nightlight

#### Parts List

- 1 10k Resistors
- 1 10k Potentiometer
- 1 470-500 ohm Resistor
- 1 NPN Transistor (2n2222 works nice)
- Protoboard
- 1 LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)/Photocell
- An LED of choice color (may need to change the value of R3)
- 2 AAA batteries (with lots of tape and

### Problems

- Lithium Ion Batteries are expensive as are battery holders. Since I needed to construct the kit on a limited budget I had to use AAA batteries and make my own battery packs using wire and electrical tape.
- Teaching circuit theory and soldering at the same time is hard... Next time focus on one of the other.
- Transistors can be tricky to read and set up
- Radioshack is expensive an unreliable.
