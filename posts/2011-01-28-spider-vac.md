## Note

This Project has been reported dead because the vacuum being used broke, and no one has had time to repair it.

### Overview

Using a common household vacuum for suction, we will build a wearable device that will climb smooth walls. A house vacuum is actually very powerful and exerts a large pressure, but it uses a small area for its nozzle. By attaching a large area pad with a rubber sealant should create enough force to stick a person to a wall. With two pads and the ability to turn off one at a time, we could scale smooth walls.

### To Do

- Calculate necessary suction from a vacuum - check
   - capable of directly holding weight onto ceiling
   - generates enough friction to hold onto a wall
   - use large safety factor

- Obtain Vacuum - check - Perform tests on vacuum
   - find way to get seal on vacuum to test weight without permanently attaching anything.

- Draw designs for pads - Gather other materials
   - wood (or some other material to make pads with)
   - rubber for sealing pads

- Build Pads - Design a way to use in the field and build - Use to either stop crime or destroy the world

### Calculations

Rough calculations have been finished. A copy is on the white board in builds. Once we have a vacuum with a known suction pressure, we can go forward.

### Designs

Designs need to be made.
