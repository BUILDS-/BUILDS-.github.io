### Printer Hunt
For the debDog package bu-printing-config, people expressed the desire to include more than just the myprint printers. I therefore propose a printer hunt! Just fill in the table with any info you have on a printer that you want put into the package.

NOTE: Departmental printers are bad, since they tend to change info fairly often, and most people would get yelled at for printing to them (even if it was auto-magically *sic* configured in an amazingly novel way).
