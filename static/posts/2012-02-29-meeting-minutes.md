### Kyle Brogle
- So new officer elections will be held the week after spring break, so submit tickets!

### John-Nicholas Furst / Dan Gastler
- The door is back in gear so talk to John to get in the database for swipe access. If the door jams, text Dan Gastler (if you don't have his number, ask him in person). If you want to hack on the door, talk to Dan or someone else on the project.
