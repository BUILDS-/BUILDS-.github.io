## Overview

Reuse systems are used for trading disused goods around campus. Individuals may get rid of useful waste by stacking potentially reusable items in a hallway or behind a building and then notifying the Reuse system of these items and their location. Users of the Reuse system are then notified via e-mail about the items; the first users to locate the Reuse Pile get dibs on what they find. Reuse piles typically exist for a week or so before they are discarded as waste by the original poster.

By setting up a reuse system at BU, we can facilitate inter-departmental (and inter-student) exchanges of useful and reusable waste (projectors, TVs, couches, electrical components, construction supplies, etc).

### The System

The reuse system can be created, in its simplest form, by making a public mailing list called reuse-list@bu.edu. Users can then add items to and remove items from the reuse-list as they see fit.

A better implementation of this system would be to create a graphical front-end and host it at builds.cc/reuse . Users would have the option of managing their own reuse accounts, and seekers could specify search terms (i.e. "couch") and be auto-notified when such an item is posted to the Reuse System. As this system grows, traffic to builds.cc would increase -- which would be a boon for our hackerspace.
