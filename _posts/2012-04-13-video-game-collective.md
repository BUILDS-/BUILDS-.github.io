## Current Status

Preparations are being made to display several of our projects at the upcoming BUILDS open house.

Meetings are tentatively set for Wednesdays from 2-3.

## Overview

The Video Game Collective is designed around a loose group of projects in game development that have been proposed by members. Some are personal projects or extensions of existing projects from academic coursework. Anyone looking to help or just learn more about game design and creation are welcome.

### Interests
- Java, C++, and C, and using OpenGL with these
- Python, using Pygame
- Blender
- Game Design

### Existing Projects
- [Untitled]: A 2.5 steampunk platformer. Main weapon/tool is a gear yo-yo, used for solving puzzles to escape the underbelly of a giant mechanical city.
- Cartographer: An exploration platformer based on an alternate 1800's Lewis and Clark America.
- [Untitled]: A rogue-like text adventure game in Python.
- Ghost in the Gymnasium: A high school janitor must escape endless waves of monsters on the night before prom. Done using Pygame.
