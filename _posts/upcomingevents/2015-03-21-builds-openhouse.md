What have you made this year?

BUILDS is BU's makerspace club where we work together on cool projects. And BUILDS would not be BUILDS if we did not make things! 

On April 15, 6:30 - 8:00 PM (MCS B26), the BUILDS Open House will be a university project showcase event to celebrate the ingenuity of student projects.

Do you have a side project you want to show off, whether it be code, robot, tech-inspired art, or any wonderful burst of unbridled creativity?

The event will be in the basement of MCS room B26 and B33. There'll be lots of food!

Come, network, tour the BUILDS room, talk, eat, and check out the cool side projects at BU on April 15, 6:30 - 8:00 PM.
