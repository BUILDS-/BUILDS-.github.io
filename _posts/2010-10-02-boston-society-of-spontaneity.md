The Boston Society of Spontaneity is not an ACM made group. Rather it is a Boston Urban Playground group, modeled after NYC's Improv Everywhere. BSOS: [http://www.soscities.org/](http://www.soscities.org/) Improv Everywhere: improveverywhere.com

Those joining this "project" will probably just get emails about meeting up to go to Boston Society of Spontaneity Event/Pranks.

Urban Playgrounding is happening on 10/10!!!

This is the facebook event for the MP3 experiment. You download a mp3 but don't listen to it until everyone arrives at the undisclosed location. Everyone listens and follows the instructions at exactly 3:30pm. Expect to make a spectacle of yourself, simultaneously as others are making spectacles of themselves.
