## 02/22/2012

### Kyle Brogle
- Project updates...Much was done this weekend!

### Dan Gastler
- The door still runs on the old code. Notice the camera above the table? It gives a live stream (.mpeg 4 video) from the camera outside the door. This was hacked together from an old thinkpad that Danny found, together with work from both Allan and Dan.

### Chris Woodall
- BUILDS bot has spawned a minibot named 12ounce. Made from the casing of an old IR motion sensor, it's a good start for the BUILDS bot project to get used to coding/ making (working) motor controls.

### Monica Gribouski
- Toby from IS&T came in and taught BUILDS multitouch how to ame polish their acrylic, so further progress is now blocking on the acquistion of new materials.

### Chris Woodall
- BUILDS has a table reserved at the Cambridge Maker Fair (on April 20th). Contact Chris/Kyle if you have any projects that you'd like to contribute.

### (KDE) Jeff Crowell
- The laser arrived for BUILDS drawbot, so work will continue this weekend. Contact Jeff if you're interested.

### George Silvis / Anthony Inzero
- Many thanks to George and Zero for traveling to Micro-Center and (successfully) building three new BUILDS computers. So sayeth Baron von Computer: if you need something installed on any of the computers, talk to George or Kyle.

### Liam Wang
- VGC is still going, but temporarily blocking on Liam surviving theatre Hell Week. If you're interested in helping out, contact Liam.

### Allan Wirth
- BUILDS Coding Bee: (Think first annual Python Bee). The acceptable languages are C, Python, and Haskell. The grand prize is a BUILDS ceiling tile with your face on it (to remain in BUILDS). If you have a language that you really want, contact Allan or George.

### Dan Gastler
- Musical Stairs:
	- New goals are to solder on two new jacks and test two new sensors. Work will begin on saturday at 3pm.

### Danny Cooper
- Work on BUILDS document camera is still in progress, but milestones are being blocked by terrible manufacturer documentation.

### Chris Woodall
- Thanks to Ian and his generous typewriter donations, BUILDS typewriter can now begin. Hacking will commence this saturday at 2pm.

### Valerie Young
- Meta Topics:
	- Funds are roughly at 600 of free-use money. If you need funding for your project, contact Valerie for other means (Jim Stone, SAO, etc). For BUILDS officer elections, the format is heading toward having a secret veto ballot (in person, not over email), and having tickets of officer groups as opposed to voting for officers individually.

### Chris Woodall
- If you want to participate in a BUILDS arduino/ soldering workshop, talk to Chris so he can get a rough idea of interest.
