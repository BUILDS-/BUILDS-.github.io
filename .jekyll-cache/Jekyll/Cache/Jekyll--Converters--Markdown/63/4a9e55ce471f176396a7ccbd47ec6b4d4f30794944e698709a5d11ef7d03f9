<h3 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h3>

<p>We are a inclusive group of students, artists, hackers, and organizers that believe strongly in experimental learning and the Do-It-Yourself ethic. We facilitate student-led technology initiatives and encourage hands-on learning by maintaining an open workshop and creative space that is freely available to all students. We maintain an inclusive membership policy, and strive to apply the principles of the open-software and open-hardware movements within our design policies. In short, we are an immersive experiment into the hacker ethic.</p>
