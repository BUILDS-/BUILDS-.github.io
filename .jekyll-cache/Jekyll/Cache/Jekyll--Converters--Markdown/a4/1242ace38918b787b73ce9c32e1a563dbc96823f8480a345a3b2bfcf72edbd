<h3 id="status-report">Status Report</h3>
<p>Currently developing a basic schematic to develop the basics of the project. The glove part is on hold, so we are making a Musical right now :D</p>

<h3 id="some-tips-on-using-these-files">Some Tips on Using These Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The schematic files are all made in EAGLE and so will the PCB Board</li>
  <li>The source code will be written for the Arduino and possibly TI Launchpad. This is for now and up to change, for example, ATtinyâ€™s might be used on each hand to do some basic signal processing before sending the signals to the Arduino.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schematicpcbsource-code">Schematic/PCB/Source Code</h3>
<p>All of the Schematics, PCB and Source Code files are hosted on github at <a href="https://github.com/cwoodall/Musical-Gloves/">https://github.com/cwoodall/Musical-Gloves/</a></p>
