I"¢<p>Is this a good way for those of us not currently at BU to submit some suggestions to the project? One thing I don‚Äôt particularly think is necessary is the output-computer at the top of the stairs. Since we already have an arduino monitoring the status of the infrared receivers, it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to throw some sound output routines in there too.</p>

<p>If it‚Äôs a small section of the staircase not too many separate voices would be required, but now that I think about it if there are a lot of voices and you want it to have a really particular voice e.g. a piano (as opposed to a sine wave, or if you‚Äôre really trying to keep the project simple, a square wave) then using a computer could greatly simplify the coding end of the project.</p>

<p>Another thing I‚Äôm worried about is the computer getting stolen.</p>

<p>If it‚Äôs not doing something like displaying a ‚ÄúMen of BUILDS‚Äù sexy advertisement calendar then we should probably try to avoid it. And for my own curiosity how precisely do the infrared LEDs/sensors work?</p>

<p>Is it at all focused, or your standard LED? Because if the infrared photons are emitting from it in a spherical manner, and the way the note is ‚Äútriggered‚Äù is by blocking the path with your foot, then you‚Äôd have to be reasonably close or the LEDs on other steps would prevent the note from triggering, right?</p>

<p>Or is it more focused than your average LED? - Jenkinsm</p>
