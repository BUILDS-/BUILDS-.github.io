<h4 id="what-is-hardware-freedom-day">What is Hardware Freedom Day?</h4>

<p>Hardware Freedom Day is a worldwide celebration of Open Hardware. Initiated in 2012 by the same organization behind Software Freedom Day it aims at educating the worldwide public about the benefits of using and promoting Open Hardware. It also provides an international day to serve as a platform to raise awareness to existing projects and communities around the world as well as encourage participation in local Open Hardware initiatives. The non-profit organization Digital Freedom Foundation coordinates HFD at a global level, providing support, giveaways and a point of collaboration, but volunteer teams around the world organize the local HFD events to impact their own communities.

<p>We will hold a hackathon in the traditional BUILDS style, except with a focus on a topic related to hardware in some way.</p>
