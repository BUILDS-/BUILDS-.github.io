<p>What have you made this year?</p>

<p>BUILDS is BUâ€™s makerspace club where we work together on cool projects. And BUILDS would not be BUILDS if we did not make things!</p>

<p>On April 15, 6:30 - 8:00 PM (MCS B26), the BUILDS Open House will be a university project showcase event to celebrate the ingenuity of student projects.</p>

<p>Do you have a side project you want to show off, whether it be code, robot, tech-inspired art, or any wonderful burst of unbridled creativity?</p>

<p>Fill out this spreadsheet, and weâ€™ll grab you a table for you to showcase your project at our expo event.</p>
