<p>Aaron was a hacktivist and friend of many in our community. He helped create RSS 1.0; contributed to Creative Commons; was an early builder of Reddit, where heâ€™s often acknowledged as a co-founder; created the web.py framework; and more recently, became a data liberator, first with PACER and then with scholarly articles from JSTOR, both of which got him into trouble with the law.</p>

<p>Aaronâ€™s Demand Progress project helped stop SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act in the US, which threatened to have far reaching unintended consequences.</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz committed suicide on Jan. 11, 2013, but his work on making the world a better place should not die with him. Join us for two days of understanding his work and contributing to keep his memory and projects alive.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>Room B26 in the Math and Computer Science building on 111 Cummington St, Boston MA 02215. (We are located in the basement)</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>Start: 12pm Feb 2</p>

<p>1pm: Hackathon Opening Meeting. Brainstorming, discussion of projects, organizing into groups.</p>

<p>8pm: Touch base meetingâ€“ talk about what everyoneâ€™s been working on.</p>

<p>Sometime during the day on Sunday weâ€™ll have a closing meeting and sendoff where we discuss whatâ€™s been worked on over the weekend. Weâ€™ll decide when this is happening once everyone has a chance to get started on projects Saturday. We canâ€™t stay in the rooms later than 8pm on Sunday, so the sendoff meeting will be before then, and weâ€™ll update the schedule here as soon as a time has been decided.</p>

<p>Note this schedule will be updated as the week progresses.</p>

<h2 id="our-space">Our space</h2>

<p>Weâ€™re associated with Boston University, so Iâ€™ve gotta throw in a disclaimer asking everyone to be considerate of our affiliation and not do anything illegal. Alcohol isnâ€™t condoned on school property.</p>

<p>Bring whatever youâ€™d like to work on; we have a lot of power outlets. Our hackerspace has more of a computer science/electrical engineering slant, so if youâ€™re planning on doing physical work, we donâ€™t have a lot of space/equipment to offer in the way of that but weâ€™ll try and accomodate. Let us know beforehand if you have something particular in mind!</p>
