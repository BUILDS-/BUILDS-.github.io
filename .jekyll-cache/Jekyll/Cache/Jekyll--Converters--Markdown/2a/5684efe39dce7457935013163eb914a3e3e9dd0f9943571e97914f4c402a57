  <li>The door still runs on the old code. Notice the camera above the table? It gives a live stream (.mpeg 4 video) from the camera outside the door. This was hacked together from an old thinkpad that Danny found, together with work from both Allan and Dan.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>BUILDS bot has spawned a minibot named 12ounce. Made from the casing of an old IR motion sensor, it’s a good start for the BUILDS bot project to get used to coding/ making (working) motor controls.</li>

<ul>
  <li>BUILDS Coding Bee: (Think first annual Python Bee). The acceptable languages are C, Python, and Haskell. The grand prize is a BUILDS ceiling tile with your face on it (to remain in BUILDS). If you have a language that you really want, contact Allan or George.</li>

  <li>Meta Topics:
    <ul>
      <li>Funds are roughly at 600 of free-use money. If you need funding for your project, contact Valerie for other means (Jim Stone, SAO, etc). For BUILDS officer elections, the format is heading toward having a secret veto ballot (in person, not over email), and having tickets of officer groups as opposed to voting for officers individually.</li>
