I"<h3 id="printer-hunt">Printer Hunt</h3>
<p>For the debDog package bu-printing-config, people expressed the desire to include more than just the myprint printers. I therefore propose a printer hunt! Just fill in the table with any info you have on a printer that you want put into the package.</p>

<p>NOTE: Departmental printers are bad, since they tend to change info fairly often, and most people would get yelled at for printing to them (even if it was auto-magically <em>sic</em> configured in an amazingly novel way).</p>

    <tr>
