<p>What is BUILDS?</p>

<p>The poor student, Jack, had been seeking for at least four years. He was a hard seeker; he was very, very honest and sincere. He practiced all that was told to him, he visited many masters, he undertook many internships. He did all that was humanly possible. He practiced coding katas, he mastered Matlab, he did this and that â€“ but all to no avail. Nothing was happening; in fact, his frustration was growing more and more. The more the methods failed, the more and more frustrated he became.</p>

<p>He had read all the Hacker scriptures â€“ there are hundreds of them. It is said about this Jack that he had the Art of Computer Programming in his room, and he was constantly reading, day and night. And his memory was so perfect he could recite whole passages of the Jargon File â€“ but still nothing happened.</p>

<p>Then one day he burned his whole library. Seeing those scriptures in the fire he laughed. He left the university, he left his advisor, and he went to live in a ruined temple. He forgot all about coding kata, he forgot all about matlab, he forgot all about practicing this and that. He forgot all about virtue; he forgot all about discipline, and he never went inside the university to code again.</p>

<p>But as he was living in that ruined temple it happened. He was mowing down the weeds around the temple â€“ not a very techie thing to do. Not anything specific, not anything special, just taking the weeds out. When he threw away a bit of broken tile, it clattered against a bamboo tree â€“ in that moment it happened. In that very clattering of the tile against the bamboo, a shock, a jerk happened and his mind stopped for a moment. In that very moment he realized BUILDS.</p>
