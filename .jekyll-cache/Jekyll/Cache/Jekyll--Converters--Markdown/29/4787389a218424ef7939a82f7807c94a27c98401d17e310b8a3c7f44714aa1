<p>Currently, the only way to achieve automatic, reliable configuration of Linux machines for BU networks and services is BU Linux. While BU Linux is effective in this sense, it has shortcomings, mainly that it is CentOS-based (which some people don‚Äôt like), and that it requires installing a completely new operating system, instead of just being able to install the config on top of an existing setup. To address these concerns, I propose an alternate system, tentatively entitled ‚ÄúdebDog‚Äù, which is a collection of debian packages that install and/or configure essential software for use on the Boston University network. It is modular, allows for deeper customization, and is installable on top of an existing debian-based distro.</p>

<h3 id="the-system">The System</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs get this out of the way right here: the inspiration for this project is MIT‚Äôs Project Debathena (<a href="http://debathena.mit.edu/">http://debathena.mit.edu</a>). While using debathena on the MIT campus, I was amazed at how easy it was to install, configure, and use. If you poke around their site, you‚Äôll notice that their system was so solid that MIT IS&amp;T started using it on all the public clusters.</p>

<p>But I digress. The packages are currently using CDBS (Common Debian Build System) along with Config-Package-Dev (MIT-developed system for using divert commands to install configs on a machine).</p>

<h3 id="the-packages-have-a-home">The Packages Have a Home</h3>

<p>Current packages live in <a href="http://www.github.com/broglek">http://www.github.com/broglek</a>. Using git is easy‚Ä¶github has directions if you‚Äôre not familiar (you‚Äôre also welcome to email Kyle).</p>

<p>When we have a set of packages that we have tested individually, it will be time to test them as a group. For this, I can use my PPA on Launchpad.</p>

<p>Also, the BU Linux Users Group expressed interest in hosting a PPA for us to use for this when we go into more of an open beta/release mode. (They‚Äôre pretty awesome).</p>

<ul>
  <li>bu-nss-config
    <ul>
      <li>configures nsswitch.conf so that BU databases (LDAP) can be used to obtain information (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch</a>)</li>
      <li>may be problematic, due to how BU‚Äôs Active Directory servers store indexID as part of the cn, and not as a separate field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>bu-pam-config
    <ul>
      <li>configures pam so that requests to log in/ssh/su/etc can be done with kerberos credentials</li>
      <li>if anyone knows more than Kyle about dealing with pam, especially from a security standpoint (he doesn‚Äôt know much), help would be appreciated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>bu-login
    <ul>
      <li>metapackage to allow logging into the local computer with kerberos accounts. Will include bu-nss-config and bu-pam-config, among others.</li>
