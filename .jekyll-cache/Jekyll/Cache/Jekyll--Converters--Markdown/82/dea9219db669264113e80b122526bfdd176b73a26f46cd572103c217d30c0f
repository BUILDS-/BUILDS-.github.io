I"<p>Some of us need books. Some of us have books. Put down what books you have or need along with some contact info in the appropriate section.</p>

<p>Also, people who are CS/Math students should feel free to use the books on the bookshelf in BUILDS…some of them are textbooks. It would be cool if they could stay in the room, but we understand if you need to take it for a night…just make sure they’re back in reasonable time, since a lot of us do our Psets down here.</p>
