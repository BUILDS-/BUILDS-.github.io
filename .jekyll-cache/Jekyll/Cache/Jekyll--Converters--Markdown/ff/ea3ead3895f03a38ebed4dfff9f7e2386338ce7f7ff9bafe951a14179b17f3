I"6<p>There are many things which break during projects, by accident, or for no reason what-so-ever. Since functional tools are much preferred to broken ones when people are working on projects the broken things should be fixed, and/or improved. This wiki page can be added to by any and all members of BUILDs and is not limited to broken things, but also any additions we want to make to the infrastructure of BUILDS, for example, infrastructure based projects. Also this page can be used to request changes and report issues.</p>

  <li>We need a better way of reporting errors maybe a bug tracking system of some sort. Might be interesting to build one that was a wiki plugin (or a wordpress plug-in) that might be interestingâ€¦</li>
