    <ul>
      <li>We had planned to do them Wednesdays after meetings, but that doesn‚Äôt work for anyone‚Ä¶</li>
      <li>The idea is for people to gather and work on projects, both ongoing and spur-of-the-moment</li>

      <li>If you‚Äôre here and see it leaking, please contact BU facilities</li>
      <li>But, we should be good for the rest of the semester, we think</li>
