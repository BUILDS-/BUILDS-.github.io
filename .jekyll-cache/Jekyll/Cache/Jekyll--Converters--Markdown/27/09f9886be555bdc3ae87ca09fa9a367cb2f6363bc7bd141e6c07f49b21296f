<p>Installed and working!</p>

<p>The desktop background stays the same at all times with a transparent terminal over it. On swipe, an alternative display based on the user id number is made using latex-beamer and converted to an image file that gets displayed with feh.</p>

<p>Currently, the display contains a 1984 reference. It has the potential to be expanded into different displays which could be rotated daily. Fun interactive door displays can be used for recruiting.</p>

<h3 id="door-computer">Door computer</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Old door computer has been placed on the floor next to the door, but moving it into the ceiling would be a better option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can access the door computer by plugging in a USB keyboard and mouse into the back of monitor on the inside of the door. The old door computer now lives above the door in a trough like structure in the ceiling. DO NOT lift the ceiling tile in the corner above the door, it has the video/power cables on it; lift the one next to it. There is currently no fixed IP, but if one uses the keyboard/mouse, they can figure out the IP and log in remotely by SSH.</p>

<h3 id="card-reader">Card reader</h3>

<p>The card reader has been physically installed, but the software backend needs to be revived.</p>

<p>Note: this reader contains magical black smoke that turns it into a keyboard, so make sure you have the active window if you are using it.</p>

<p>Currently, the card reader is used to display interesting “information” on the door screen. This is done in a screen session named “SwipeControl”, through 3 files (I’ll upload them soon!).</p>

<ul>
  <li>masterrun.sh
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This creates a full screen gnome-terminal on the door screen (nifty) and executes run.sh in it. 
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>run.sh
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This script loops over waiting for a card swipe, generating interesting outputs, and displaying them on the door screen. 
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>troll.c
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This script turns off keyboard echoing to the screen and waits for a card swipe.   After a card swipe, it helps generate the output generated in the run.sh script.
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After doing some measurements and looking at tech sheets we have determined that this one will fit our door.</p>

<p>A request for money has been sent to the BUILDS secretary.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, the install should be quick.</p>

<p>Cable feedthrough is in place for door webcam.</p>

<h3 id="old-builds-room">Old BUILDS room</h3>

<p>The door has been upgraded from its original RFID reader to a magstripe reader. The main cause of this is the cost of purchasing RFID tags. Now bu students may use bu ids to swipe into BUILDS and non-bu members may use any magstripe card they wish as their swipe card.</p>

<p>The door upgrade has also added a monitor outside of the door.</p>

<p>While right now it doesn’t have much use besides looking cool, it will eventually host announcements and general news.</p>
