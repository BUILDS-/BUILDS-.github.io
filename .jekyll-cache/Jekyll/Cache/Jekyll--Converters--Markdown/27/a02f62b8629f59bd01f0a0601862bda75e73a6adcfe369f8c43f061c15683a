I"|<p>BUILDS went through some recent changes starting with a forced change move as the building went under construction. We managed to hold on to most our original personality and stuff, but not everything made the trip. Some replacements had to be made especially in the art department.</p>

<p>Luckily, we have been able to quickly make up for what has been lacking thanks to some industrious BUILDSers. Take a look. Here are some pictures for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>TARDIS by Patrick</p>

<p>Previously known as the Boat Room (and a cornucopia of worse names), our small tool closet has been converted into the TARDIS. Naturally, this will give us a great deal more storage space since time lord technology makes it bigger on the inside.</p>

<p>Door by Dan, Pat, and me</p>

<p>Instead of working we revamped the door decoration today to have a fun interaction. I love this one, and you should check it out, but I want to see some variety. Contact Dan, if you have more ideas of what could be displayed there. We throw up a random one and swap it daily.</p>

<p>Red by David</p>

<p>….David wanted to help decorate so we gave him a nice easy project… He even did it all by himself.</p>

<p>SS Air Jelly (working title) by Monica</p>

<p>“Swag on! I’m so much better at painting than any of you.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monica ‘The Gribbler’</li>
</ul>

<p>There is plenty of wall space left as well as doors and cabinets. Stake your claim now talk to Monica if you want to do a big project. She is the baroness von taste now.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>p.s. We added some barons to assist the officers.</p>
