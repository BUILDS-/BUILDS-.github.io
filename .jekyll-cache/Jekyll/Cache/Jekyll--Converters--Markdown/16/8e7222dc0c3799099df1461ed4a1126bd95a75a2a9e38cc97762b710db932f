<p>This Project has been reported dead because the vacuum being used broke, and no one has had time to repair it.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Using a common household vacuum for suction, we will build a wearable device that will climb smooth walls. A house vacuum is actually very powerful and exerts a large pressure, but it uses a small area for its nozzle. By attaching a large area pad with a rubber sealant should create enough force to stick a person to a wall. With two pads and the ability to turn off one at a time, we could scale smooth walls.</p>

<h3 id="to-do">To Do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate necessary suction from a vacuum - check
    <ul>
      <li>capable of directly holding weight onto ceiling</li>
      <li>generates enough friction to hold onto a wall</li>
      <li>use large safety factor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Obtain Vacuum - check - Perform tests on vacuum
    <ul>
      <li>find way to get seal on vacuum to test weight without permanently attaching anything.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Draw designs for pads - Gather other materials
    <ul>
      <li>wood (or some other material to make pads with)</li>
      <li>rubber for sealing pads</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build Pads - Design a way to use in the field and build - Use to either stop crime or destroy the world</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="calculations">Calculations</h3>

<p>Rough calculations have been finished. A copy is on the white board in builds. Once we have a vacuum with a known suction pressure, we can go forward.</p>

<h3 id="designs">Designs</h3>

<p>Designs need to be made.</p>
