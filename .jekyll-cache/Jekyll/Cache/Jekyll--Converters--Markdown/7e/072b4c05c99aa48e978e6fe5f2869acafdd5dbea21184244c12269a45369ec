I"À<p>BUILDS and Furst Labs are working together to perfect a multi-touch screen. The physical screen must be engineered for optimal finger blob tracking. Fingers are individually tracked on the surface using modified web cameras. The camera input is fed into custom tracking program designed by Furst Labs which implements the latest standard of Open Computer Vision. The tracker program then sends the individual tracked data points over a modified Tangible User Interface Objects protocol tunneled through the Open Sound Control protocol to another custom Furst Labs built program for gesture tracking and recognition. Once gestures have been recognized this program responds appropriately by either opening other applications or interacting with the userâ€™s graphical interface.</p>
