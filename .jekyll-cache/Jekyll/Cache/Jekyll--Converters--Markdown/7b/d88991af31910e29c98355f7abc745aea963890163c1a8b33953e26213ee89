I"™<p>We should throw a hacker movie festival on campus. This would require cooking copious amounts of popcorn and projecting classic hacker movies onto the walls of a BU machine room or otherwise questionably fitting cyberpunk-y location. Or just securing room 330 in CAS, depending on how many collective strings we can pull.</p>

<h3 id="possible-additional-movies-or-snippits">Possible additional Movies or snippits:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Conversation (1974) - You can never be too paranoid ;-)</li>
  <li>Ghost in the Shell (1995) - or just the scene with the reality loop.</li>
  <li>Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004) - or just the uber cool scene where the firewall (complete with robot ‚Äúwatchdogs‚Äù) is breached on the robot production ship.</li>
  <li>Possible TV episodes or snippits: La Femme Nikita: #215 ‚ÄúFuzzy Logic‚Äù - [Birkoff] (TENSE VOICE) Sir, I‚Äôm sorry, we‚Äôre in the middle of a multiple anomaly. There is also some episode where birkoff actually feeds actual *nix commands (a ps pipe and then a kill I think) to an operative in the field :-)</li>
  <li>La Femme Nikita: #103 ‚ÄúSimone‚Äù Ah, here it is‚Ä¶ BIRKOFF: Sit down at the main keyboard. (Nikita scoots over to the keyboard, staying low) Type exactly what I tell you. PS dash E. PS dash‚Ä¶ All right. That‚Äôs got to be it. It‚Äôs the only process I don‚Äôt recognize. All right, type this in; Kill, space, minus-nine, space, 313. Okay? You got that? That should do it. [‚Ä¶] Tense seconds shoot past as automatic gunfire rattles all around.</li>
  <li>Dr. Who - all of it. IMHO Dr. Who is the media character I‚Äôve seen that best exemplifies the hacker (sometimes called ‚Äúethical hacker‚Äù since media have conflated ‚Äúhacker‚Äù to mean ‚Äúcracker‚Äù).</li>
</ul>
