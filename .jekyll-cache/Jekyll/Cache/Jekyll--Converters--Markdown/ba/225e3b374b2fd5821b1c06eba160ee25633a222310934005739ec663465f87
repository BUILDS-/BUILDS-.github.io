<ul>
  <li>Ability to communicate amongst each other and w/ a computer of choice</li>
  <li>Distributed vs Centralized (Ender Wiggin vs Bugger Queen)</li>
  <li>Low Cost for reproducibility</li>
  <li>Possibly of different types and specs. Or all the same. For example: ** Feelers. Collision detection. Used to map out the area.</li>
  <li>Movers. Extra actuatorsâ€¦ Possibly using electromagnets to move metallic objects around</li>
  <li>Philosophers. Computation nodes, can also move.</li>
</ul>
