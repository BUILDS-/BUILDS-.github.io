I"ê<p>The Boston Society of Spontaneity is not an ACM made group. Rather it is a Boston Urban Playground group, modeled after NYC‚Äôs Improv Everywhere. BSOS: <a href="http://www.soscities.org/">http://www.soscities.org/</a> Improv Everywhere: improveverywhere.com</p>

<p>Those joining this ‚Äúproject‚Äù will probably just get emails about meeting up to go to Boston Society of Spontaneity Event/Pranks.</p>

<p>Urban Playgrounding is happening on 10/10!!!</p>

<p>This is the facebook event for the MP3 experiment. You download a mp3 but don‚Äôt listen to it until everyone arrives at the undisclosed location. Everyone listens and follows the instructions at exactly 3:30pm. Expect to make a spectacle of yourself, simultaneously as others are making spectacles of themselves.</p>
