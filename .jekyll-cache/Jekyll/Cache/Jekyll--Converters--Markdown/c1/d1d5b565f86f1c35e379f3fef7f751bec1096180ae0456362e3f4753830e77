<p>the BUS now has GPS, which means we can track it. Unfortunately the tracking site is pretty terrible. <a href="http://www.bu.edu/maps/?lat=42.346714230174676&amp;lng=-71.10033988952637&amp;zoom=15&amp;bus_widget_box=on&amp;bus_box=on&amp;route_box=on&amp;livebus_box=on&amp;bus_schedule=weekday/">BUâ€™s BUS tracker</a> refuses to load nicely on default many mobile browsers (android, opera mini, blackberry) doesnâ€™t have any information about bus speed, time to stops, schedule correction due to traffic at that time etc. We want to change this.</p>

<p>currently donâ€™t know. will update when find out/someone who knows posts it (John?), may (will?) have impact on chosen software.</p>

<p>Google Maps BUâ€™s â€˜officialâ€™ site uses google maps. Real time tracking is certainly possible using google maps. There are other mapping softwares available such as openlayers, something by microsoft and a few more. I donâ€™t know much about any of these. Anyone who does, feel free to voice their opinions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opengts.org/">OpenGTS</a> is a free real time GPS tracking project under the Apache License. Would require a server running the OpenGTS. From the demos looks very promising.</p>

<p>OpenGTS is pretty much ideal for this project as it seems very powerful and flexible and has a nice <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/poweropengts/index.php?title=Quick_Installation_guide_Ubuntu_Server_10.04_LTS_and_OpenGTS">install guide</a>, but Iâ€™m open to other ideas.</p>
