I",<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>I want a project issue tracker</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>We do projects! We need someway to track progress and more importantly to track issues. We are distributed and many times multiple people work on a project. A bugtracker can be perfectly utilized for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>Up for consideration:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/">Mantis</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">BugZilla</a></p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>.</p>

<p>Trac is another great tool. However it is a bit bloated and a hefty install. It has its own wiki which just adds unneeded overhead when we already have one.</p>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Install Mantis on a BUILDS server</li>
  <li>Add links to Mantis on Builds homepage</li>
  <li>Post update to BUILDS homepage about new feature</li>
  <li>Send e-mail about new feature</li>
</ul>
