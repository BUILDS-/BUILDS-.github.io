<h3 id="kyle-broglejohn-nicholas-furst">Kyle Brogle/John-Nicholas Furst</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New policies
    <ul>
      <li>Starting this semester, we want EVERYBODY who uses the room regularly to GET INVOLVED in projects</li>
      <li>The website will be updated soon to accomodate Project leaders keeping track of members who are, in fact, involved in their projects.</li>
      <li>The point is that BUILDS was created as a project space. Over the course of the past year, however, it has become more study- oriented.</li>
      <li>This is not a BAD thing, but it is not the purpose of this space.</li>
      <li>People are still welcome to study at BUILDS, we just ask those that use the room regularly to be actively involved in the spirit of BUILDS.</li>
      <li>NOTE: THERE WILL BE/ARE TONS OF PROJECTS FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT FIND YOU NICHE, CREATE ONE.</li>
    </ul>
