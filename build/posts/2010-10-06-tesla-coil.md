## What is a Tesla Coil?

On the technical side of things a Tesla coil is a pair of resonant RC circuits that operate at voltages high enough to create arcs. The idea is that there are two coils of wire called the primary and the secondary that act as inductors for their respective circuits. A large toroid acts as the capacitor for the secondary circuit as well as a site for the arcs to discharge. A large bank of capacitors connects to the primary coil forming the primary circuit. The primary and secondary circuits are designed so that they have the same resonance frequency and will transfer power between one and the other.

### Project Goals

- Construct a small working Tesla coil
- Experiment with attaching a keyboard to Tesla coil
- Build a large scale Tesla coil to amaze friends and crush enemies
- profit

### Build Order

There's a lot of online documentation about how to put one together a coil. One site is linked below and it walks through design specs using a sensible progression from a desired arc length. Using this site I've done a few calculations for a coil designed around a 6 diameter secondary coil.

### Materials

Most of the materials can be found easily on McMaster Carr, but the one thing thats holding up calculations is acquiring a high voltage transformer either from a microwave or a neon sign. Otherwise, major materials as follows:

- copper wire (secondary coil)
- aluminum ducting (toroid)
- copper tubing (primary coil)
- capacitors (primary circuit)
- Hi V transformer
- other assorted odds and ends to be accounted for
