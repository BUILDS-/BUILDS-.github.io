We should throw a hacker movie festival on campus. This would require cooking copious amounts of popcorn and projecting classic hacker movies onto the walls of a BU machine room or otherwise questionably fitting cyberpunk-y location. Or just securing room 330 in CAS, depending on how many collective strings we can pull.

### Possible movies:

- WarGames
- TRON
- The Manhattan Project
- Sneakers
- The Pirates of Silicon Valley
- Hackers
- Takedown
- Antitrust
- Johnny Mnemonic
- 23 (1998)
- RevolutionOS

What say ye, oh undulating masses of techies? Comment below.

Also, thanks to Prof. Kinraide for this idea :D

### Possible additional Movies or snippits:

- The Conversation (1974) - You can never be too paranoid ;-)
- Ghost in the Shell (1995) - or just the scene with the reality loop.
- Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004) - or just the uber cool scene where the firewall (complete with robot "watchdogs") is breached on the robot production ship.
- Possible TV episodes or snippits: La Femme Nikita: #215 "Fuzzy Logic" - [Birkoff] (TENSE VOICE) Sir, I'm sorry, we're in the middle of a multiple anomaly. There is also some episode where birkoff actually feeds actual *nix commands (a ps pipe and then a kill I think) to an operative in the field :-)
- La Femme Nikita: #103 "Simone" Ah, here it is... BIRKOFF: Sit down at the main keyboard. (Nikita scoots over to the keyboard, staying low) Type exactly what I tell you. PS dash E. PS dashâ€¦ All right. That's got to be it. It's the only process I don't recognize. All right, type this in; Kill, space, minus-nine, space, 313. Okay? You got that? That should do it. [...] Tense seconds shoot past as automatic gunfire rattles all around.
- Dr. Who - all of it. IMHO Dr. Who is the media character I've seen that best exemplifies the hacker (sometimes called "ethical hacker" since media have conflated "hacker" to mean "cracker").
