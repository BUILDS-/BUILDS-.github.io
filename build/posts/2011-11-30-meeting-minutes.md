## 11/30/2011

### A meta meeting has occured! check you email for further details.
- How does the meeting time work for everyone? It's impractical to change for this term, but a doodle will be sent soon for next semester.

### Chris Woodall
- Circuit workshop
	- If you want to pick some new knowledge about playing with circuits, stayed tuned and check email. Will most likely start next term.

### Kyle Brogle
- BUILDS CTF
	- Who would be interested in a BUILDS CTF?
	- Would be great practice for all those who like (love) network security.
	- Again, due to people being swamped with finals, will probably start next semester.

### John-Nicholas Furst
- BUILDS Door Upgrade
	- Great job everyone! Further progress now blocking on the acquisition of hardware
