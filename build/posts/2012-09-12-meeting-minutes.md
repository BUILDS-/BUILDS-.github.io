### Introduction to builds
- builds is the place for you to learn that. we exist to facilitate learning, especially through collaboration.
the way builds works:
	- meetings: weekly, wednesdays, 6:30. everyone gets together to talk about events and current projects. this meeting not representative, more like an orientation.
	- events: hackathon, indiegamefest, hackny, csaw
	- the room: open 24/7. if you stick around, we'll give you swipe access; right now the door will always be unlocked. come in and work in between classes, stop by to check out the tools. After classes end we can use power tools, so on any given night you'll find people in here working. we also are going to start unlocking classrooms next door to use as middle of the night homework hubs.
	- projects: if you have a project, you can propose it. first of all you just pitch it to the group at a meeting to see general interest. if it's cheap, doesn't need a lot of people, cool, start working on it right away-- if it's big, we require you to submit a project proposal (which is great for learning how to write design docs) to the officers to review, get funding, etc. then becomes project w/ weekly meeting times etc. time at the end for new pitches.
