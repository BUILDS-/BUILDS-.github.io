Playing music with gloves

### Status Report
Currently developing a basic schematic to develop the basics of the project. The glove part is on hold, so we are making a Musical right now :D

### Some Tips on Using These Files
* The schematic files are all made in EAGLE and so will the PCB Board
* The source code will be written for the Arduino and possibly TI Launchpad. This is for now and up to change, for example, ATtiny's might be used on each hand to do some basic signal processing before sending the signals to the Arduino.

### Schematic/PCB/Source Code
All of the Schematics, PCB and Source Code files are hosted on github at [https://github.com/cwoodall/Musical-Gloves/](https://github.com/cwoodall/Musical-Gloves/)
