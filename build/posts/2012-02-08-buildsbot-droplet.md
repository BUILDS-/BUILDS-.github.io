### Specifications and GoalsBuild a swarm of semi intelligent robots The swarm robots should achieve the following things:

- Ability to communicate amongst each other and w/ a computer of choice
- Distributed vs Centralized (Ender Wiggin vs Bugger Queen)
- Low Cost for reproducibility
- Possibly of different types and specs. Or all the same. For example: ** Feelers. Collision detection. Used to map out the area.
- Movers. Extra actuators... Possibly using electromagnets to move metallic objects around
- Philosophers. Computation nodes, can also move.
