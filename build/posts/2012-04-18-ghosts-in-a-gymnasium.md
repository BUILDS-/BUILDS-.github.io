## Overview

Before the game starts, the player has the opportunity to move blocks (Chairs) around anyway he or she wishes. Once finished, two Ghosts will spawn, along with three mice. The player must kill mice and feed the ghosts to buy time before they catch him or her. The ghosts will move fast enough before the first feeding where they will catch the player. Gaining time for yourself involves feeding the ghosts without being eaten by them. The goal in the game is to see how long you can survive without being eaten.

You'll need to have pygame, and numpy installed to run. To run 'python game.py'
