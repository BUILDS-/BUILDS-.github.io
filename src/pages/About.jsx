            <p>
              BUILDS is an inclusive group of students, artists, hackers, and
              organizers who believe in the do-it-yourself attitude and hacker
              ethic.

              <em>What is hacking?</em>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The idea of hacking is learning and building upon existing ideas
              and reinventing systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of hacking as the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or
              improve upon those ideas or systems to learn and understand how
              they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter who you are, you can create art and something inspiring
              on a computer, electronics, and anything that you put your mind
              to.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you feel strongly about an idea or want to learn about
              something, show your enthusiasm, be bold, and youâ€™ll find people
              who share your passion of discovery and learning here at BUILDS!
            </p>
